            <br><h2>Research section</h2>
            <p>To create this individual portfolio website, I have done tremendous amount of research. To create a sleek, simple website, I went through different sites to learn some design form them. Since, I have learned something from those websites so, I have to acknowledge them by providing reference to their site. Therefore, I am including this research section <br><br><h3><mark>1. Sir Samir Alam (Teacher fo Itahari International College):</mark></h3> &nbsp I visited website of our teacher Mr Samir Alam sir and got some idea from his website. I tried to learn the idea of Navigation bar and simple sleek looks of the site, although I could not fully design as Samir Alam sir website but I managed to make a navigation bar which is transparent. Here is the <a style="background-color: none; padding: 0; margin: 0; width: 30px;" href="http://sameeralam.com.np/?fbclid=IwAR3i3CX6dACPorMye090fxoTh984GoDC3gvq5p1YT1UBBLYL1p9JHrKk_H0&i=1" target="_blank">link.</a> <img src="../../images/sameer-sir-website.png"> <br><h3><mark>2. W3school:</mark> </h3> &nbsp While designing my webstie, I got many problems such as problem with the tags, css styling, etc. To resolve these problems, I found a great website which gives free information about almost all the topics of web development such as HTML, javascript, css. I learned many things from this site, so it would not be fair if I don't mention this site. Here is the <a style="background-color: none; padding: 0; margin: 0; width: 30px;" href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">link</a> </p> <img src="../../images/w3school.png">
